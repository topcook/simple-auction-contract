# BCDV1016

Final project for the course BCDV1016 - Introduction to Smart Contracts from [Blockchain Development](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/blockchain-development-program-t175/) program from [George Brown College](https://www.georgebrown.ca)

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are computer protocols designed to automatize the steps of a real contract. Ethereum blockchain was the first successful implementation of smart contracts developing the [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) programming language.

## Assignment problem

This assignment simulates an Auction having a fixed amount of items. Anyone with a valid address can register yourself as a bidder. Maximum of four people. Having a registration, users may bid any of the four items up to its token balance. The winners are randomly choosen and only the auction owner can reveal the winners.

There is a user interface made with plain HTML/CSS/JS along with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) in order to stablish a connection between the UI and smart contract deployed in [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
